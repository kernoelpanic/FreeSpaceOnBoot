# Ubuntu free space on /boot

This bash script should help handling this update-error which occures regularly when useing Ubuntu 14.04 with full-disk-encryption:
```
The upgrade needs a total of XX,X M free space on disk '/boot'. 
Please free at least an additional XX,X M of disk space on '/boot'. 
Empty your trash and remove temporary packages of former installations using 'sudo apt-get clean'.
```
